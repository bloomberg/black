## What is this repository?

This repository is a fork of Python Software Foundation's Black repository, created so that Bloomberg's
engineering team can collaborate with each other (and the rest of the Black community)
on enhancements to Black. Branches in this repository represent 'work in progress' that
will be contributed to the Python Software Foundation Black repository when the work is ready for review.

If you have any questions about the branches in this repository, feel free to open an issue
so our team can discuss them with you.
